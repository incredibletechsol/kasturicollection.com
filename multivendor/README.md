## To do
- Fix code intentions and adapt standard OpenCart coding styles.  
- Write Multi Vendor theme development structure.  
- Write Multi Vendor module development structure.  

## Extensions
Multi Vendor extensions can be created using the same pattern like OpenCart extensions.
VQMODS will work though you have to check if they really fit with the Multi Vendor script.

## Themes  
Currently we can't say which theme will exactly fit with our Multi Vendor, though we offer customization of OpenCart themes to fit this Multi Vendor at a cost.  
Email: info@ovicko.com for questions regarding customization.
